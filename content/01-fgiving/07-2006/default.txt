Text: # The Year of the Razor Sharp Mohawk Slapfest

Year: 2006 11th Annual
Organizers: Vogel (Skilz Competition), Dyer + Bats(Saturday), Zac (Dinner), Seth (Friday + 40s)
Locations: Alumni House (Dinner), F-House 2233 14th St. (Friday and Saturday)
Friday Night Party: Extreme Mohawk Punk Party
definitely won by Rich S (Alumni) with a mighty impressive performance... tate allen (Alumni) receives an honorable mention for best mohawk (upstairs & downstairs).
Saturday Hat Games: 
Teams: The Sex Pistols, The Dead Kennedys, Black Flag, The INXS
Saturday Skilz Competition:
Throw for Distance: Jon Fink (80), Laura Sanda (51)
Throw Run Catch: Rich Sanda (47), Linda Casill (13)
Accuracy: Adam Poulos (7), Tracy (5)
Overall: Adam Poulos, Linda Casill
totally dominated by the Old Doods -- the top undergrad finished in 7th place?! (the lady undergrads did slightly better with 2nd & 3rd place finishes). Adam P (Alumni) takes home the hunting hat and yours truly (Alumnae) was fortunate enough to take home the motion activated "Sweet Home Alabama" jeep with the dancing deer strapped to the hood of the car (quite possibly the worst toy i have ever seen)
Saturday Alumni Challenge Game: Curents 16 – Old Doods 14
We were complete dicks for the first half of the alumni/current game.  The current team didn't let this shake them and had a pretty sweet come back at the end (being down about 2 points the entire game).  Game was to 14 and they tied it at 14 and then scored 2.

## Seth’s Synopsis

2006 was an sexellent year!!! Dyer was pissed that upon his graduating and becoming an alum the Old Doods had lost the streak.  So the god’s fated the Old Doods to lose again most likely due to Dyer’s extreme amount of emails saying the opposite. He Jinxed it haaaard.  Tate really likes Mohawks and as such got everyone else to really like Mohawks.  I added the theme to pretty much explain why everyone should like Mohawks and as a result the Punk Party was hatched and it was GLORIOUS!!!  I have never seen so much hair, pukey hair, burning hair, hair flying off fans, hair in butts, peeeyy hair, ninja hair, purple jennie hair.  It was insane and disturbing, but awesome.  I’m not really sure what Rich Sanda did to awe Linda, but I’m sure it was epic.  What I did see was the belly slapping which I thought was 07 but I was way off, it happened this year and it was beautiful!  Saturday was frekin windy as hell and cold and Old Doods lost most likely to cheating.  We bagged the last hat games.  Dinner was in the Alumni House because we couldn’t get Sage.  We did extreme full dining hall rosham a few times. Jennie was looking mad sexy.  Definitely fell in love with her cuteness that night and vowed to hook up with her as soon as possible.  40s was pretty lame with a very small showing of alums.  Dyer didn’t even come after all of his huhah. Mike had to one up last years 40 drinkage by drinking 3 40s in like 20 minutes before most had finished one or two.  Adam Poulos obviousely took home the Green Jacket with his insane frolf skilz.  And thus endeth 2006!

## Famous Quotes and Trash Talk before F-Giving

“So for all those of you who are new or just really drunk last year, we're
approaching one ofthe greatest RPI events, Frisbee Thanksgiving.  Just a 
couple of details for those unfamiliar with Thanksgiving.  When Trudge
was first colonized the pilgrims faced many hardships.  Discs didn't just
fall out of the sky when you called poach.  It took many years before 
this young college team developed into a team with "games" and several
more years before anyone developed a flick.  So to give thanks for how
far we have come we invite our alumni back to campus so we can apply a 
beating so savage it has been rated XXX.  During the weekend we start
with a party on Friday.  Then we roll out of bed hungover and play a
round robin of current and alumnim mixed teams.  Then the most important 
game of the fall season is played when our current team plays our alumni
team.  Then after we put the smakc down on those 3 drink weenies we will
go have a Thanksgiving dinner and then another party.  This is probably 
one of the coolest tournaments/weekends of ultimate you be apart of.
Basically what you should get out of this is, reply if you can come on
teh 11th of November.”

“Don’t worry Batman, the Alumni will win this year.  Your fluke victory last year can be blamed on Greg Sanda intentionally distracting us with wind up.  I will personally blow by you.”
-Dyer

“could you guys take a break from rubbing one out to Desperate Housewives or whatever you do now that you've graduated and pick a date for Thanksgiving? I hear you've been dragging your feet cause you don't want to get your ass handed to you both on the field and at the party.”

-Bats

“I can understand if the old dood's wouldn't want to come this year.  They did get defeated handily last year and i can understand if those bruises still hurt.  Plus, Trudge is 16-2 this year including a 15 game win streak and a tourney win at Clarkson.  Come to think of it, the old dood's might as well stay at home because they don't stand a chance.”

“You forgot to mention how we've won like ten thousand parties already this year too. And how we plan on drinking them under the table like woah. 

But what else is new”
-Jennie

“As all of you know, the annual thanksgiving alumni ultimate trudge drink-a-feast-a-flick-a-thon is once again upon us. I am happy to inform you that because Dyer is organizing this years festivities and because I am so out of shape that just thinking about running makes me tired I will tell you how to win friday nights party. The night will start off with the general puruesing and jolly making with maybe a quick bouts of skill at stump and nose bleed. Quick fits of laughter and revelry may be heard through the din of ultimate players drinking and boasting about thier good ole days when we used to win only on world's greatest points. Universe points one might gufaw at the possibility. As things get settled, the olympics of beveraging shall commence. First round will start off with the general yaht race that we all have grown to love. Weeding out the weak quickly this drinking match will make the young pee themselves and the old giggle with glee. With half of the teams removed from competition we move onto a new favorite survivor flip cup. One might say this game takes skill and prowess. Another might say fuck that and drink bitch! Finally after much consumption and legendary deeds we shall move onto a final game of 80 cup beirut. And as always the winning team will claim superiority of all lesser teams. This glorious night will culminate with me mocking the passed out freshmen and YOU having an amazing freakin time!”

“I may remind all the currents that it took me graduating for them to finally beat the alumni.  the alumni are 9-1 in this game.  with such savage beatings at 15-5 (my freshman year) 15-like 3 (sophomore year) 15-not very much (junior year) and 15-10 (senior year, we had greg sand on our team for some reason).  You guys can forget about winning.  I will be too drunk to play and fuck this year up.”

“I will be attending Frisbee thanksgiving, and I shall drink until Mike looks like a sexy slut.”

“In other news, I'm putting my money on the Old Dudes (and Dude-ettes) over the current "players" this year.  Between the current "player's" "good season" and win last year they're in perfect position for the "everyone saw it coming, but that didn't make it any less painful" loss this year. 

PS - Who is making the rosters for the teams this year, and is someone coordinating beverages for the debauch (I was thinking I'd grab a keg for Friday night, I owe it what with my corporate conversion earlier this year).  Just thought it might be a good idea to make sure that there was ample beer to saturate the carpets of the Frisbee house with.”

“I hope you are all planning your Mohawks as we speak. I have enough hair to make a huge one. I'll be exactly like a male peacock. Only way different. 
I've been thinking about going to a barber to have it professionally done for
Maximum performance... but that might be embracing the very establishment that Mohawks claim to be against. I hope this paradox solves itself by Thursday night, aka "Mohawk night".

No offense, but I'm predicting that I will have the best Mohawk. By far. Suckas.”

-Tate

“I aspire to prance around my house on velvety floor of alumni hair.”
-Mike

“sounds like a party theme to me:
whoever can go into the "shave-room" and come out with the most removed hair wins.
hair ripped out by hand counts triple.
the team (A/B/C/D or alum/current) with the most gets to swagger.
this is a game best played after several beers.

bump, set, preemptive comedy: "hey vogel, i bet you could win without touching a hair on your head!"  
nice one jim, tate, brandon.  nice one.

on a related note: trash talk has been reduced to a bunch of stuff i don't understand between clowns i've never heard of.  and this: "meow"??”
-Vogel

“Pure fucking genius Vogel.
What's next years party theme?
Who's the fattest?
Who has the weirdest purple penis?
Who looks most like a terrorist?

The possibilities are endless, aren't they?”
-Tate

“Woot thanksgiving!

Jen and I are showin up to that eat fest thang.

I say punk theme! And not new pussy avril punk. Im talking fuck the rules,
steal your parents shit, pierce your kidney because its hardcore, sex
pistols, punch a baby, british punk!”

Seth "I have nipples, can you milk me?" Stewart

“Alright you crazy bitches.  We’ve got some teams with team names inspired by Seth Stew-a-baby.  As for the party I suggest several punk central activities building upon the glorious idea presented to us by the gifted Tate.”

“oh! on that note, there's a sweet sex move called the
Abe Lincoln. It goes in steps (Laura Sanda, please
stop reading here, not cuz I'm gonna get all freaky
some night, but cuz I think you'll be mad at me for
being funny and gross, but mostly funny):

step 1: shave your pubes and place them on your
bedside table
step 2: engage in intercourse with someone in your bed
step 3: when you're about to finish, pull out and do
your business on your partner's chin and outer face
step 4: throw the pile of pubes in your partner's
face!
step 5: enjoy the shocked, confused and very angry
face of our 16th president growling up at you!

sorry Lolo,”
Greg

“So is the offical theme PUNK ROCKERS!!!??
who's ready to see the most frotastic mohawk the world has yet to comprehend!!
muhahaha....”
 
Kendra Krueger

“The official party theme is “Real punk, not that frufru bay area green day bullshit”  so wear all of your extraordinarly tight ugly jeans, pierce your lip and prepare for the Mohawks.
 
Skillz competition will mirror last year’s, only Steets won’t win.
 
See you all tomorrow night, party at the 14th st fhouse at 10.”

-Dyer

“That makes me 2-0 for all the alumni games (undefeated, if you can’t handle that math).

Forgive me if I’m wrong Dyer, but doesn’t that mean that you, personally, have never won an alumni game?”

-Mike

“We were complete dicks for the first half of the alumni/current game.  The current team didn't let this shake them and had a pretty sweet come back at the end (being down about 2 points the entire game).  Game was to 14 and they tied it at 14 and then scored 2.  That and they threw a completely ridiculous party on Friday.  It was a damned fine frisbee thanksgiving.  My main complaints were that there wasn't any ice-cream with the pie and where were the kegs for the round robin play? 

I don't think anyone got a picture of all the people who had mohawks lined up together.  There were some good ones.  Tate probably had the best one (but he's an alumni, so what do you expect).

Round robin play went pretty well.  We had 4 teams named after punk bands.  I think this is the order: We played the first game, had the throw for distance competition (82 yards down/side wind was the winner?), had the second game, then the throw, run and catch competition in the opposite direction as the huck for distance (48 yards?, Rich Sanda was the winner here).  Someone voted to skip the third game which resulted in the third game being half ram-sho and also half small games to 3 (at least on one field).  Then we had the current/alumni game followed by the accuracy competition (which involved 5 throws at a frisbee-golf goal/bucket, 1 point for hitting the chain and 2 points for getting it in). 

Lots of blustery wind that made it interesting.  The fields were set up so that one side was always going into the wind (rather than the wind going cross-field).

thanks to the current team for hosting and for a great time.. sorry about that one body check on the pick. 
(if someone could forward this on to the current team list, that would be appreciated)”

“While this account is just about entirely accurate, I would like to point
out that the kegs weren't at the fields on Saturday because we kicked
both on Friday night at 4:30 am. We also received the standing ovation
from Alden for doing so, as promised.”
