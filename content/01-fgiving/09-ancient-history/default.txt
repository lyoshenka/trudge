Title: Ancient History

Hmmm... let's see...
there was the one across from the park on 15th street that housed Rich, Tate, Brandon and Matt from fall 1996 to spring 1997, I believe that someone frisbee associated lived there the previous year as well, but this was my first year, so I don't really know.
 
then the following year we moved to 2172 14th street, there were 9 of us, all frisbee players.  We lived there from fall 1997 until spring of 2000, a wide assortment of people (all frisbee I think) moving in and out.
 
after that Vogel and I moved next door to 2174 14th street for a year (I think) and Nicole joined us halfway through.  We lived only on the first floor.  I believe that the entire house was rented after that by frisbee players...
 
I don't recall too much past, but there you have it.  1996 through spring 2001 covered.

And if you guys think Tate and company are the ancient dudes, then I'm probably extinct. 
I remember whooping Tate and Steet-O and the rest of the crew around the field when they were freshmen!
To fill in some more history:
1989 - Team was comprised of mostly 5th year archies
1990 - Team was non-existent as most of the team graduated (see above)
1991 - Etkind and I save RPI Frisbee from extinction and swindle the student union out of about $1000 to cover expenses for our team
1992 - We attract some good players and start winning games
1993 - We start winning tourneys and dominating the local colleges, however the entire team is upperclassmen again
1994 - Big transition from the old guys to the young guys and we keep winning
1995 - The first frisbee house.... see below
