Text: # Everything Old is New Again

## Friday

- The 20th F-Giving, themed around rehashing and remixing previous themes, challenges, and inside jokes.
- 6 teams, because there were so many people.
- 3 character classes: Warrior, Bard, Wizard. Everyone picks one and dresses as that class. Classes are not related to teams. 
- Wizards create wizard sticks. A stick of length 6 or more turns the wizard into a Master wizard.
- Bards wear clothes of the 6 colors of the rubics cube. They swap clothes until they are a solid color. Then they become a Master bard.
- Warriors may take a shot before any challenge. If they do, they are "Berzerking" that challenge.
- Master wizards, Master bards and Berzerking warriors get +1 for each challenge they complete.
-  Most challenges are either fan favorites from previous years or jokes about specific people.
