Title: How to Play

----

Text: ## The Rules

- Spirit is of the utmost importance.
- For the tee-off, whoever scored lowest on the last hole throws first.
- For other throws, whoever is furthest from the hole throws first.
- Pivot goes where the disc is, so you can pivot forward (this is not disc golf).
- You must hit the target in a place you could touch from the ground (i.e. if the target is a tree, hitting a tree branch 20ft overhead does not count).
- One mulligan per 9 holes (one for front 9, one for back 9).
- Water is determined based on where the center of the disc is.

### Penalties

- Water (where cars drive) = +1 penalty
- Car= +1 penalty
- Glass = +2 penalty
- Getting hit by someone else's disc= +1 penalty
- Hitting a bird, squirrel, or Public Safety = -1 bonus

### Skins

- Lowest score on each hole shotguns a beer or does a shot
- If there's a tie for lowest score, there's no penalty. On the next hole, lowest score does 2 shots/shotguns
- Continue adding up shots until there's a single winner for a hole
